*Heart Disease Detected with 95% accuracy

# Project: Detect Heart Disease using patient data 
Objective
Build a system that can predict if a patient has heart disease. Explore the data, understand the features, and figure out an approach. 
1️⃣   Data Exploration & Understanding Features
•	You'll likely use a dataset like the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, which contains medical attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.
•	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to visualize distributions and correlations.
•	Check for missing values and outliers that might impact predictions.
•	Conduct feature selection to identify the most important attributes for prediction (e.g., using correlation matrices or domain knowledge).
2️⃣   Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
•	Apply scaling techniques (e.g., Min-Max Scaling, Standardization) to normalize numerical features.
•	Encode categorical variables (e.g., using one-hot encoding for categorical medical conditions).
•	Consider feature extraction, such as polynomial features or PCA, if dimensionality reduction is needed.
3️⃣   Choosing an ML Model
•	Since this is a classification problem (predicting disease presence), consider models like:
o	Logistic Regression (interpretable, baseline model)
o	Random Forest / Decision Trees (handles non-linearity well)
o	Support Vector Machine (SVM) (for high-dimensional data)
o	Neural Networks (ANN) (if you want to explore deep learning)
•	Evaluate models using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess their performance.

4️⃣   Hyperparameter Tuning & Model Optimization
•	Utilize GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters.
•	Try cross-validation (e.g., k-fold) to improve generalization.
5️⃣   Deployment Strategy
•	Wrap the trained model using Flask or FastAPI for an API-based deployment.
•	Deploy on a GitHub if scaling is required.
